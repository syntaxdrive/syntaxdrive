    <div><p>NASA’s Deep Space Network Welcomes a New Dish to the Family</p></div>
    <p>The addition brings new capabilities to the network, which acts as an interplanetary switchboard, connecting us to missions at the Moon and far beyond.
    
    <p></p>A powerful new antenna has been added to the NASA Space Communications and Navigation’s Deep Space Network (DSN),<br> which connects us to the space robots exploring our solar system. Called Deep Space Station 56, or DSS-56, the dish is now online and ready to communicate with a variety of missions,<br> including NASA’s Perseverance rover when it lands on the Red Planet </p>
    <p>The new 34-meter-wide (112-foot-wide) dish has been under construction at the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex in Spain since 2017.<br> Existing antennas are limited in the frequency bands they can receive and transmit, often restricting them to communicating only with specific spacecraft.<br> DSS-56 is the first to use the Deep Space Network’s full range of communication frequencies as soon as it went online.<br> This means DSS-56 is an “all-in-one” antenna that can communicate with all the missions that the DSN supports and can be used as a backup for any of the Madrid complex’s other antennas.
    “DSS-56 offers the Deep Space Network additional real-time flexibility and reliability,” said Badri Younes, deputy associate administrator and program manager of NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN). “This new asset symbolizes and underscores our ongoing support for more than 30 deep space missions who count on our services to enable their success.”</p>
